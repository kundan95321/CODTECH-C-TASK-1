##Overview of the project

PROJECT : QUIZ GAME

Objective

The primary objective of this C program is to create a simple interactive quiz game that:

    Engages users by presenting multiple-choice questions.
    Allows users to select answers and provides immediate feedback on their responses.
    Tracks and displays the user's score at the end of the game.

Key Activities

    Defining the Question Structure:
        A Question structure is created to encapsulate each quiz question, its possible answer options, and the correct answer.

    Displaying Questions:
        A function (displayQuestion) is implemented to print the question and its answer options to the console, allowing for user interaction.

    User Interaction:
        The program prompts the user to answer each question and captures their input.
        It ensures that the input is case-insensitive by converting it to uppercase.

    Answer Validation:
        The user's answer is compared against the correct answer stored in the Question structure.
        Feedback is provided immediately after each question, indicating whether the answer was correct or incorrect.

    Score Tracking:
        A score variable is maintained to count the number of correct answers.
        At the end of the quiz, the total score is displayed to the user.

Technologies

    Programming Language: C
        The code is written in C, a high-level programming language known for its efficiency and control over system resources.

    Standard Input/Output Library: stdio.h
        This library is included to facilitate standard input and output operations, such as reading user input and printing to the console.

    Data Structures:
        The program uses a structure (struct) to manage related data (questions, options, and answers) in a cohesive manner.

    Control Flow:
        for loops are used to iterate through the questions, and conditional statements (if statements) are utilized to validate user responses and provide feedback.
